"description":"Equipped with 2 HDMI InputsThe DuraVision FDF2305W is equipped with DVI-D 24 pin and D-Sub mini 15 pin inputs for digital and analog signal support respectively. It also has two HDMI inputs which support both PC and AV signals and can be connected to video cameras, recorders, and other AV devices.Full HD (1920 x 1080) LCD PanelImages are displayed pixel-by-pixel in full high definition that fills the entire screen. Images taken with full HD cameras are reproduced in detail.Smart Resolution for Sharper ImageEIZO-patented super-resolution technology called Smart Resolution analyzes the displayed content for noise and blur. It ensures that noise is not accentuated while correcting the blur to the extent needed to sharpen the image. For images with a lot of depth, it sharpens the foreground more strongly to reproduce the depth that simulates a real world sense of focus.Day and Night Preset Modes3 preset modes are included: sRGB, Day, and Night. The latter two presets are optimized to match Day mode and Night mode (monochrome) used in digital cameras. You can easily switch between modes using a single button on the included remote control.Visibility in Dark Areas with Smart InsightAutomatically detects areas that are difficult to see and adjusts the brightness of each pixel, reproducing images with a realistic sense of depth. Figures that used to be difficult to see in digital imaging are now made visible.Reduce Reflective LightA non-glare panel dissipates reflective light that would normally make the screen difficult to view and strain the eyes.Display Moving Images ClearlyAn overdrive circuit accelerates gray-to-gray response time which minimizes ghosting and blurring during high motion scenes for clear video reproduction.Equipped with ContrastEnhancerContrastEnhancer controls the LED backlight during videos. It has a 5000:1 contrast ratio that produces dark, realistic blacks and presents a clear display when contrast is increased.Smooth GradationsThe input signal from a PC with 8 bits per RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color is converted to 14 bits within the monitor. Using gamma correction with a 14-bit LUT, the monitor chooses the best colors and returns the data to 8-bits to produce smooth display of gradations.Automatic Brightness AdjustmentAn Auto EcoView sensor on the front of the monitor detects ambient light and automatically optimizes the screen's brightness. Since the screen is never too bright or too dark, eye strain is reduced while power consumption is also cut.LED BacklightThe LED backlight has a wide dimming range, adjustable to as low as 3 cd/m2. This makes it possible to use the monitor in dark places or environments where the illumination can change dramatically.Compact Remote ControlChange inputs, sound, screen size, color mode, etc. directly using the included compact remote control.Versatile PositioningAdjust the monitor to the most comfortable position for working with height adjustment, tilt, and swivel capability.Standless Mount OptionThe stand can be easily removed to allow for wall mounting using the VESA mount screw-holes.",

"description":"Reduce Reflections for Image ClarityAnti-reflection (AR) coating greatly reduces reflections caused by outside light without affecting the light emitting from the monitor. This makes AR preferred over AG (anti-glare) treatments which cause blacks to appear washed out due to diffusion of the backlight. Monitors with AR coating display digital mammography, chest X-ray, and other high-resolution images with more clarity for accurate analysis.Streamline Your WorkflowEffectively replace a dual 3 megapixel monitor setup with a 6 megapixel screen capable of displaying all necessary image applications at once to streamline the radiology workflow.Keep Space EfficientThe new design saves more space than a typical dual-monitor setup to make the work area more efficient. In addition, the narrow space between the bezel and screen also makes cleaning easy.Optimize Color & Monochrome BrightnessThe Hybrid Gamma function distinguishes monochrome and color images, displaying each in optimal brightness and tone when viewed on same screen. This expands the usability of multi-modality applications by allowing accurate review of color and monochrome mix images.Conveniently View Images Side-by-SideTwo screens from separate input signals can be displayed simultaneously on one monitor. The widescreen enables simple and flexible operation without obtrusive bezels in between when viewing images side-by-side.Keep Your Monitor Lit LongerThe LED backlight offers a significantly longer service life over conventional CCFL. In addition, you can maintain high-brightness while simultaneously lowering power consumption.Make the Precise DiagnosisEIZO carefully measures and sets each grayscale tone to create a monitor compliant with DICOM Part 14. This ensures the most consistent shading possible, allowing for the most accurate diagnosis.Maintain the PrecisionPerform a simplified calibration compliant with DICOM Part 14 using the bundled RadiCS LE quality control software. RadiCS LE corrects the brightness and grayscale tones of the monitor to maintain image accuracy and consistency over time.Manage Effortless Quality ControlA built-in Integrated Front Sensor (IFS) measures brightness and grayscale tones to calibrate to DICOM Part 14. The IFS does not interfere with the viewing area while in use to cut workload and maintenance costs needed for monitor quality control.Comfortably View from Any AngleWide viewing angles allow you to view the screen from the side with minimal color shift, also permitting more than one person to view the monitor comfortably at the same time.View Accurate Images in MomentsThe EIZO-patented drift correction function quickly stabilizes the brightness level of the monitor upon startup or wakeup from sleep mode, giving you the most accurate images quickly ready for viewing. In addition, a sensor measures the backlight brightness and automatically compensates for brightness fluctuations caused by ambient temperature and aging for a consistently stable display.Attain Steady Images Across the ScreenThe Digital Uniformity Equalizer (DUE) function helps to even out fluctuations in brightness and chroma on different parts of the screen to provide smoother images.Select the Ideal Mode for ModalitiesThe CAL Switch function allows you to choose various modes for different modalities such as CR, CT, and endoscopy. It can be conveniently accessed using the monitor's front panel buttons to easily switch to optimal image viewing conditions.Conserve Energy While AwayA presence sensor prompts the monitor to switch to power save mode when the user is away and resumes operation upon their return to conserve power when not in use, uniting convenience with savings.Improve OperabilityEIZO's highly versatile stand offers, tilt, swivel, and a wide height adjustment range, enabling you to use the monitor with greater comfort.Stay Confident with Stable BrightnessEIZO's confidence in its product quality extends to brightness stability which is also covered during the usage time specified in the warranty.Rest Assured with Medical QualificationsThe monitors meet the strictest medical, safety, and EMC emission standards.Warranty with Safety and TrustEIZO and its authorized distributors offer a five-year limited warranty.",

Even your updates reach you as soon as they are available so you always have the latest and greatest features that are built to keep up with your on-the-go lifestyle.Stay untethered for even longer - All Windows 10 devices now have Battery Saver to automatically conserve power – so you can work longer and play harder.Sleek style. Serious substance.Peak performance: With up to a 5th Gen Intel® Core™ processor, the Inspiron 13 packs a robust performance. Count on plenty of power for loading apps or editing photos.Built-in stylus: Sketch, take notes or retouch photos with the freedom of a built-in stylus. The Inspiron 13 is ready for whatever you create.More room: The Inspiron 13 offers up to a 500GB Hybrid Hard Drive, providing you with 14 times more storage than a 32GB tablet. There's enough room for all your favorite music, apps and more.Vibrant display: A 13.3" display with optional Full HD makes details pop on screen.

Full-size HDMI port uses commonly-available HDMI cables to connect to your living room TV or high-resolution display in your study to see your images and videos up on the big screen – no need for awkward, easy-to-lose adapters common to other systems using mini-HDMI or DisplayPort.Designed for the real world — because that's where life happens.We want you to love your new PC for years to come. That's why we test Inspiron laptops for reliability not just in the places where you expect it, but for the open road ahead.Turn up the heat: From locker rooms to locked cars, we test Inspiron laptops for survival in harsh short-term heat conditions of up to 65°C/149°F.Everything hinges on it: We test Inspiron laptop hinges to ensure they still feel tight, even after opening and closing the lid 20,000 times.Keys to success: We test commonly used keys for 10 million keystrokes and touch pad buttons 1 million times with no failure. So go ahead, finish your novel.Buttoned up: No matter what you set your power and multimedia buttons to do, we've tested them all to survive up to 40,000 pushes.Twist and turn: Call us excessive, but after twisting an Inspiron laptop's base and lid more than 25,000 times, we can assure you the parts inside are well protected.Always a good fit: You'll probably never need to remove and reinstall your Inspiron's battery 30 times, but you can rest easy knowing that we've tested even that.",

The Inspiron 13 is ready for whatever you create.More room: The Inspiron 13 offers up to a 500GB Hybrid Hard Drive, providing you with 14 times more storage than a 32GB tablet.

That's why we test Inspiron laptops for reliability not just in the places where you expect it, but for the open road ahead.Turn up the heat: From locker rooms to locked cars, we test Inspiron laptops for survival in harsh short-term heat conditions of up to 65°C/149°F.Everything hinges on it: We test Inspiron laptop hinges to ensure they still feel tight, even after opening and closing the lid 20,000 times.Keys to success: We test commonly used keys for 10 million keystrokes and touch pad buttons 1 million times with no failure. So go ahead, finish your novel.Buttoned up: No matter what you set your power and multimedia buttons to do, we've tested them all to survive up to 40,000 pushes.Twist and turn: Call us excessive, but after twisting an Inspiron laptop's base and lid more than 25,000 times, we can assure you the parts inside are well protected.Always a good fit: You'll probably never need to remove and reinstall your Inspiron's battery 30 times, but you can rest easy knowing that we've tested even that.",

"name":"Huawei S5720-36C-PWR-EI-AC Managed Gigabit Ethernet (10/100/1000) Power over Ethernet (PoE) 1U Black",
"description":"Easy operation and maintenanceThe S5720-EI supports Super Virtual Fabric (SVF), which virtualizes core, aggregation and access switches, and wireless APs into one device for simplified management. SVF virtualizion also enable plug-and-play provisioning of access switches and APs; and supports profile-based service configuration and automatic delivery of configurations from core devices to aggregation and access devices.Easy Operation provides zero-touch deployment, enabling the replacement of faulty devices without additional configuration; plus USB-based deployment, batch configuration, and batch remote upgrades — greatly reducing O&M costs.Further flexibility is provided by support for Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) v1, v2c, and v3; a Command Line Interface (CLI), web-based network management systems, and Secure Shell (SSH) v2.0. Support for Remote Network Monitoring (RMON), multiple log hosts, port traffic statistics collection, and comprehensive network quality analysis help in network consolidation and reorganization processes.S5720-EI models with prepositive power sockets can be installed in 12-inch (300 mm) depth cabinets, and can be maintained through the front panel for easy operation and maintenance. Cabinets can be placed against the wall or back-to-back for installation in small equipment rooms.Powerful service processing, QoS and security featuresThe S5720-EI supports Multi-VPN-instance CE (MCE), providing secure connections of users in different VPNs. Large, multi-instance routing tables isolate users in different VPNs, who connect to a Provider Edge (PE) device through the same physical port on the switch — reducing VPN deployment costs. The S5720EI also supports MPLS feature in hardware.Built-in Quality of Service (QoS) features include queue scheduling and congestion control algorithms — assigning priorities based on MAC address, IP protocol type, and TCP/UDP Ports. Specialized priority queuing and multi-level scheduling mechanisms enable management of service quality based on performance requirements of different users, terminals, and services.eNetwork Admission Control (NAC) functions support 802.1x authentication, MAC address authentication, portal authentication and hybrid authentication, and dynamic delivery of policies for VLANs, QoS, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and user groups. Authentication-free network segments can be specified, with redirection of HTTP connection requests for provisioning new users and services. Portal authentication provides fast deployment in the case when clients do not support HTTP access.Comprehensive security features protect against DoS attacks including SYN flood, Land, Smurf, and ICMP flood attacks. The system also defends against user-targeted attacks such as bogus Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server attacks, IP/MAC address spoofing, DHCP request floods, and changes made to the DHCP Clent Hardware Address (CHADDR) value.The S5720-EI creates and dynamically maintains a DHCP snooping binding table, and discards the packets that do not match the table entries. IT administrators can specify DHCP snooping on trusted and untrusted ports to ensure that users connect only to authorized DHCP servers.Access Resolution Protocol (ARP) learning feature protects the network against ARP spoofing attacks to ensure normal network access.Flexible Ethernet networkingIn addition to traditional Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP), and Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP), the S5720-EI supports Huawei-developed Smart Ethernet Protection (SEP) technology and the latest Ethernet Ring Protection Switching (ERPS) standard. SEP is a ring protection protocol specific to the Ethernet link layer, and enables support of ring network topologies such as open ring, closed ring, and cascading ring topologies. ERPS, defined in ITU-T G.8032, provides millisecond-level protection switching based on traditional Ethernet MAC and bridging functions.The S5720-EI supports Smart Link and Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), which implements backup of upstream links. One S5720-EI switch can connect to multiple aggregation switches through multiple links, significantly improving uptime availability and reliability.Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) support enables interconnected devices to exchange connection information; the Media Endpoint Discovery (MED) enhancement ads the ability to obtain Layer 2 information and dynamically provide parameters needed to support VLAN, security, and QoS policies to IP telephony devices.Multiple-connection fault detection mechanisms include Ethernet OAM (IEEE 802.3ah/802.1ag /ITU Y.1731) and Bi-directional Forwarding Detection (BFD).Intelligent iStack virtualization and clusteringHuawei’s exclusive iStack technology combines multiple switches into a single logical switch. Custered switches can be combined in redundant configurations for improved network reliability, and used with inter-device link aggregation to enhance link reliability. Scalability is made easy, as the number of ports, bandwidth, and total throughput can be increased by adding switches to the stack — without disrupting the network. Device configuration and management are also simplified, making O&M easier and reducing TCO.Use iStack virtualization to combine up to 9 physical switches into one logical device, and log into any member of the stack to manage all the switches in that stack. A S5720-EI Switch can be added to a stack using its dedicated stacking cards for lower latency and higher reliability. For more flexibility, two 10 Gbit/s ports on the 2 x 10 Gbit/s interface cards can be used for communications over longer distances.Mature IPv6 technologies for next-generation networkingS5720-EI Switches run Huawei’s robust VRP software platform, and provide IPv4/IPv6 support for smooth migration to future networking. Comprehensive IPv6 routing protocols (RIPng, OSPFv3, BGP4+, and IS-IS for IPv6) and IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels including manual, 6-to-4, and Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) tunnels enable the product to support a pure IPv4 network, a pure IPv6 network, or a shared IPv4/IPv6 network — truly future-ready switches.",
